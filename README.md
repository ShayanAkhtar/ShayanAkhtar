## Hey there! I'm Shayan Akhtar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a deep interest in Flutter development and expertise in languages like C++, C, and Python. I believe in the transformative power of technology and its ability to shape the world for the better. My goal is to contribute to this positive change through my programming skills and innovative projects.

ðŸ’» Technologies and Skills:

- Flutter: Building beautiful and performant cross-platform applications.
- C++: Developing efficient and robust software with a focus on data structures and algorithms.
- C: Exploring low-level system programming and memory management.
- Python: Utilizing its versatility for web development, data analysis, and automation.

ðŸš€ Projects:

Here are a few notable projects I've worked on:

1. [Matrix Manipulation(C++)](https://github.com/ShayanAkhtar/Matrix_Operations): This program is written in C++ and provides various operations on matrices. It allows users to perform operations such as        transposing a matrix, calculating the sum of rows and columns, and performing binary operations (multiplication, addition, and subtraction) on two matrices.
2. [Transposition Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program(C++)]: This C++ program implements the Transposition Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.    The Transposition Cipher is a classical cryptographic technique that rearranges the letters of a message based on a given key.
3. [Flight Management System(C++)]: It is a system that will manage flights of an airline for both users and admin.
    Admin are able to manage Flight Numbers, Departure, Destination etc. while user can book their flights, view and cancel them as well.
